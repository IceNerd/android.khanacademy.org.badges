# Khan Academy Badges

I recently did an interview project for KhanAcademy.org and the results were well received. This project shows off a strong foundation for an app that consumes an api.

## The Request

For this project, we'd like a simple phone app that tells students what the different challenge patches represent. The first screen should be a collection of all the badges, and tapping any single badge should bring up a detail view for that badge (preferably with a larger image and more verbose description!).

Our entire collection of badges lives here: http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/badges
